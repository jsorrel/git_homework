### [What's the use of the staging area in git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49228209/whats-the-use-of-the-staging-area-in-git) on Stackoverflow (15 min)

The idea of the staging area is frequently one of the trickiest concepts to wrap your head around when you're first learning git. Read the question and answers (or do your own Googling on the git staging area). Then, create your own metaphor comparing the staging area to something in real life. 

- [ ] Type your metaphor below:
The staging area is simlar to the Expedite, or expo, station in a kitchen, where meals are staged before being served. In the kitchen, sides and entrees will be added to the area and the Expediter will request items that are necessary for a plate, similar to adding, and sometimes deleting (rejecting an item for modification) files from a commit. When the meal is ready to be served, the expediter will check that all components are completed to the restaurant's standards and diners' specifications, like reviewing a diff. If everything checks out, the meal is 'committed' (ready to serve) and 'pushed' by the server to the table.
